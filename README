Assignment 7: Backtracking

---

Puzzle.hs contains the Puzzle class implementation, according to the
specification.

Zeno.hs contains a couple of very simple "puzzles", used to test the
Puzzle class. (This file contains no required deliverables and can be ignored.)

Kakuro.hs contains the rest of the deliverables: the Kakuro puzzle
implementation itself. This includes functions like across, down, make,
digits, etc., as well as the solved and choices functions required for the
puzzle implementation.


A note on "down". In the documentation provided, the arguments to the
down function are, in order:

    down row column sum length
    
However, in the demo puzzle provided, the "row" and "column" arguments seem to
be reversed. As printed in the writeup and using the argument order from the
documentation, the Kakuro puzzle will not be created correctly (and is in fact
unsolvable, according to our implementation). To remedy this we have switched
the order of arguments to down in our solution, viz. down is now:

    down column row sum length
    
After making this trivial change to the down function, our implementation worked
as expected and the puzzle was solved.
